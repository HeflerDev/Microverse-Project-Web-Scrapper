## About the Project 

The objective of this project is to create a scraper developed in Ruby, so I focused the program to scrap prices of things in e-bay, those things can be whatever you want to type in the program searcher.
As all capstone projects In microverse, the due time is 3 working days, but I will continue working on it afterwards because it turned out to be something really interesting.
