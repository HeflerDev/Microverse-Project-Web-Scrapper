I could not get your project running as I kept getting error. There is no gemfile and gemfile.lock in your project where you can require all the packages you're using from. 

Please check to confirm you have pushed all your files.

Your README.md file should contain information about setting up and running it as well.

Not that you do have currently, but a .gitignore file should be in your project where you can add all the files you do not want to publish.

It is a best practice to write tests for your methods.

 Install RSpec and write some tests.
 
 All of your files contains dom manipulations. It's a good practice to separate your app logic from dom manipulation so you should have a separate file meant for dom manipulation methods like chomp, puts etc
 
 Fix all these and request for a re-review. Your next pull request should contain a description of what you have done (i.e. itemise the changes you have made and what it can do)You should be certified a master in one last re-review. Good luck!
